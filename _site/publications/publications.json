However,\ndefining and identifying estimands that can guide policies in infectious\ndisease settings is difficult, even in an RCT. The effects of\nvaccination critically depend on characteristics of the population of\ninterest, such as the prevalence of infection, the number of vaccinated,\nand social behaviors. To mitigate the dependence on such\ncharacteristics, estimands, and study designs, that require conditioning\nor intervening on exposure to the infectious agent have been advocated.\nBut a fundamental problem for both RCTs and observational studies is\nthat exposure status is often unavailable or difficult to measure, which\nhas made it impossible to apply existing methodology to study vaccine\neffects that account for exposure status. In this work, we present new\nresults on this type of vaccine effects. Under plausible conditions, we\nshow that point identification of certain relative effects is possible\neven when the exposure status is unknown. Furthermore, we derive sharp\nbounds on the corresponding absolute effects. We apply these results to\nestimate the effects of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine on SARS-CoV-2\ndisease (COVID-19) conditional on post-vaccine exposure to the virus,\nusing data from a large RCT.\n\n\n\n",

However, initiating\ntreatment immediately after recurrence may negatively impact quality of\nlife without any survival gains. Therefore, we consider sustained\nstrategies for initiating treatment based on specific characteristics of\nprostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can indicate disease progression.\nWe define the protocol for a target trial comparing treatment strategies\nbased on PSA doubling time, in which androgen deprivation therapy is\ninitiated only after doubling time decreases below a certain threshold.\nSuch a treatment strategy means the timing of treatment initiation (if\never) is not known at baseline, and the target trial protocol must\nexplicitly specify the frequency of PSA monitoring until the threshold\nis met, as well as the duration of treatment. We describe these and\nother components of a target trial that need to be specified in order\nfor such a trial to be emulated in observational data. We then use the\nparametric g-formula and inverse-probability weighted dynamic marginal\nstructural models to emulate our target trial in a cohort of prostate\ncancer patients from clinics across the United States.\n\n\n\n",

This study aimed to estimate\nthe risk of preterm birth (overall, spontaneous, and indicated) after\nCOVID-19 during pregnancy, while considering different levels of disease\nseverity and timing.\nMethods: Pregnant and recently pregnant people who\nwere tested for or clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy\nenrolled in an international internet-based cohort study between June\n2020 and July 2021. We used several analytic approaches to minimize\nconfounding and immortal time bias, including multivariable regression,\ntime-to-delivery models, and a case-time-control design.\nResults: Among 14 264 eligible participants from 70\ncountries who did not report a pregnancy loss before 20 gestational\nweeks, 5893 had completed their pregnancies and reported delivery\ninformation; others were censored at time of their last follow-up.\nParticipants with symptomatic COVID-19 before 20 weeks’ gestation had no\nincreased risk of preterm delivery compared to those testing negative,\nwith adjusted risks of 10.0% (95% CI 7.8, 12.0) vs. 9.8% (9.1, 10.5).\nMild COVID-19 later in pregnancy was not clearly associated with preterm\ndelivery. In contrast, severe COVID-19 after 20 weeks’ gestation led to\nan increase in preterm delivery compared to milder disease. For example,\nthe risk ratio for preterm delivery comparing severe to mild/moderate\nCOVID-19 at 35 weeks was 2.8 (2.0, 4.0); corresponding risk ratios for\nindicated and spontaneous preterm delivery were 3.7 (2.0, 7.0) and 2.3\n(1.2, 3.9), respectively.\nConclusions: Severe COVID-19 late in pregnancy\nsharply increased the risk of preterm delivery compared to no COVID-19.\nThis elevated risk was primarily due to an increase in medically\nindicated preterm deliveries, included preterm cesarean sections,\nalthough an increase in spontaneous preterm delivery was also observed.\nIn contrast, mild or moderate COVID-19 conferred minimal risk, as did\nsevere disease early in pregnancy.\n\n\n\n",

We describe here the\ncohort and share the lessons learned. The IRCEP enrolls women tested for\nSARS-CoV-2 or with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy\nregardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results and obtains information using an\nonline data collection system. By the end of March 2021, 17,532\nparticipants from 77 countries had enrolled; 54% enrolled during\npregnancy and 46% afterwards. Among women with symptomatic COVID-19 with\na positive SARS-CoV-2 test (N=4,934), symptoms were mild in 41%,\nmoderate in 52% and severe in 7%; 7.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19\nand 1.7% were admitted to an intensive care unit. The key practical\nchallenge has been retention of the large number of participants\nenrolled during pregnancy through social media. The biggest\nmethodological challenge has been the potential bias introduced when\nparticipants enroll after pregnancy outcomes are known. Multiple biases\nneed to be considered when estimating and interpreting the effects of\nCOVID-19 in pregnancy in these types of cohorts.\n\n\n\n",

In vitro\nfertilisation (IVF) is a risk factor for IPD, and the magnitude of\nincrease in risk differs for individuals using donor oocytes (donor IVF)\nversus their own oocytes (autologous IVF). In addition, multifoetal\ngestations, which are more common in IVF than non-IVF pregnancies, also\nare a risk factor for IPD.\nObjective: To quantify the contribution of\nmultifoetal gestations to the association between IVF and IPD.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study\nat a tertiary hospital from 1 January, 2000 to 1 August 2018 using\nelectronic medical records and state vital statistics data. IPD was\ndefined as preeclampsia, placental abruption, small for gestational age\n(SGA) birth or an intrauterine foetal demise due to placental\ninsufficiency. We used mediation analysis to decompose the total effect\nof IVF on IPD into a natural direct effect and an indirect effect\nthrough multifoetal gestations. We repeated the analyses separately for\ndonor and autologous IVF. All models were adjusted for maternal age,\nrace, parity, insurance, year of delivery and account for multiple\npregnancies per person.\nResults: We identified 86,514 deliveries, of which\n281 resulted from donor IVF and 4173 resulted from autologous IVF. IVF\npregnancies had 1.99 (95% CI 1.88, 2.10) times the risk of IPD compared\nto non-IVF pregnancies, and 75.5% of this increased risk was mediated by\nmultifoetal gestations. Autologous IVF pregnancies had 1.95 (95% CI\n1.84, 2.07) times the risk of IPD compared to non-IVF pregnancies, and\nthe per cent mediated was 78.8%. Donor IVF pregnancies had 2.50 (95% CI\n2.09, 2.92) times the risk of IPD, but the per cent mediated was\n37.5%.\nConclusion: The majority of the association between\nautologous IVF and IPD was mediated through multifoetal gestations;\nhowever, this was not the case for donor IVF pregnancies.\n\n\n\n",

Methods for assessing these biases have their own limitations. Many quantitative sensitivity analysis approaches consider each type of bias individually, while more complex approaches are harder to implement or require numerous assumptions. By failing to consider multiple biases at once, researchers can underestimate or overestimate their joint impact. We show that it is possible to bound the total composite bias due to these three sources, and to use that bound to assess the sensitivity of a risk ratio to any combination of these biases. We derive bounds for the total composite bias under a variety of scenarios, providing researchers with tools to assess their total potential impact. We apply this technique to a study where unmeasured confounding and selection bias are both concerns, and to another study in which possible differential exposure misclassification and confounding are concerns. The approach we describe, though conservative, is easier to implement and makes simpler assumptions than quantitative bias analysis. We provide R functions to aid implementation.\n\n\n\n",

Mediation analyses can be valuable in many reproductive health contexts, as mediation analysis can help researchers to better identify, quantify and understand the underlying pathways of the association they are studying.

We used causal directed acyclic graphs to demonstrate the types of bias that can result when selection into that sample is associated with the exposure or outcome of interest, or with both. These selection mechanisms can affect both the internal and external validity of a study. We reviewed approaches to selection mechanisms that affect valid causal inference.\nRecent Findings\nWe noted that selection bias can refer to a number of issues with different consequences. We identified strategies for addressing selection bias when designing studies, collecting data, conducting analyses, and assessing possible bias in those analyses.\nSummary\nUnderstanding the way in which a study sample relates to the target population is critical for avoiding and addressing bias.

This bias can occur whether or not that selected population\nis the target population and can occur even in the absence of\nexposure–outcome confounding. However, it is often difficult to quantify\nthe extent of selection bias, and sensitivity analysis can be\nchallenging to undertake and to understand. In this article, we\ndemonstrate that the magnitude of the bias due to selection can be\nbounded by simple expressions defined by parameters characterizing the\nrelationships between unmeasured factor(s) responsible for the bias and\nthe measured variables. No functional form assumptions are necessary\nabout those unmeasured factors. Using knowledge about the selection\nmechanism, researchers can account for the possible extent of selection\nbias by specifying the size of the parameters in the bounds. We also\nshow that the bounds, which differ depending on the target population,\nresult in summary measures that can be used to calculate the minimum\nmagnitude of the parameters required to shift a risk ratio to the null.\nThe summary measure can be used to determine the overall strength of\nselection that would be necessary to explain away a result. We then show\nthat the bounds and summary measures can be simplified in certain\ncontexts or with certain assumptions. Using examples with varying\nselection mechanisms, we also demonstrate how researchers can implement\nthese simple sensitivity analyses.\n\n\n\n",

In the industrial zone of Marseille, there is a long history of pollution, but little is known about the health implications. This study documented the prevalence of different health issues in two heavily polluted towns in the industrial zone using a CBPR approach.\nSubject and methods: This study used a CBPR approach and epidemiologic methods to answer community members’ questions about the health of residents in Marseille’s industrial zone by randomly sampling a cross-section of residents to systematically document health issues in Fos-sur-Mer and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône, two towns in the industrial port area of Marseille, France.\nResults: Many chronic illnesses were elevated in these communities, as compared to regional and national prevalences, including chronic skin problems, asthma, cancer, and diabetes. Chronic skin problems and asthma were among the most common chronic illnesses reported. A majority of respondents also reported acute symptoms that affected daily life, including eye irritation or nose and throat problems.\nConclusion: There is likely an environmental explanation for why, even after direct standardization, the prevalences of many diseases were higher in these communities than elsewhere. The combination of CBPR and rigorous epidemiologic methods helps make our findings relevant to both community members and researchers.\n\n\n\n",

Mothers (n=2,952) reported pregnancy and child (n=5,660) developmental information at multiple time points. Child total, internalizing, and externalizing problems at ages 9–11 years were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), collected biennially until 2012. Associations between prepregnancy BMI and child BPI outcomes were examined, as well as two- and three-way interactions by race and gender. Analyses were conducted in 2017.\nResults\nBoys whose mothers had higher prepregnancy weights exhibited higher total BPI and externalizing scores at ages 9–11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers. Boys with severely obese mothers had higher total BPI (mean difference=7.99, 95% CI=3.53, 12.46) and externalizing (mean difference=5.77, 95% CI=1.50, 10.04) scores. Prepregnancy underweight was associated with boys’ higher total BPI (mean difference=2.34, 95% CI=0.02, 4.66) and externalizing (mean difference=3.30, 95% CI=0.69, 5.91); these associations were not significant in sensitivity analyses. No associations emerged for girls or internalizing problems. Two-way interactions by race and three-way interactions by race and gender were not significant.\nConclusions\nMaternal prepregnancy weight was associated with BPI level among boys. Boys with severely obese mothers exhibited markedly higher behavioral problems at ages 9–11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers, regardless of race. Maintaining healthy prepregnancy weight may be important for preventing boys’ deleterious behavior outcomes in middle childhood.\n\n\n\n",
