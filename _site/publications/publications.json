In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a risk factor for IPD, and the magnitude of increase in risk differs for individuals using donor oocytes (donor IVF) versus their own oocytes (autologous IVF). In addition, multifoetal gestations, which are more common in IVF than non-IVF pregnancies, also are a risk factor for IPD.\nObjective: To quantify the contribution of multifoetal gestations to the association between IVF and IPD.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital from 1 January, 2000 to 1 August 2018 using electronic medical records and state vital statistics data. IPD was defined as preeclampsia, placental abruption, small for gestational age (SGA) birth or an intrauterine foetal demise due to placental insufficiency. We used mediation analysis to decompose the total effect of IVF on IPD into a natural direct effect and an indirect effect through multifoetal gestations. We repeated the analyses separately for donor and autologous IVF. All models were adjusted for maternal age, race, parity, insurance, year of delivery and account for multiple pregnancies per person.\nResults: We identified 86,514 deliveries, of which 281 resulted from donor IVF and 4173 resulted from autologous IVF. IVF pregnancies had 1.99 (95% CI 1.88, 2.10) times the risk of IPD compared to non-IVF pregnancies, and 75.5% of this increased risk was mediated by multifoetal gestations. Autologous IVF pregnancies had 1.95 (95% CI 1.84, 2.07) times the risk of IPD compared to non-IVF pregnancies, and the per cent mediated was 78.8%. Donor IVF pregnancies had 2.50 (95% CI 2.09, 2.92) times the risk of IPD, but the per cent mediated was 37.5%.\nConclusion: The majority of the association between autologous IVF and IPD was mediated through multifoetal gestations; however, this was not the case for donor IVF pregnancies.\n\n\n\n",

We developed the International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) to provide data on the risk of major adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes among women with varying degrees of severity and timing of COVID-19 exposure during pregnancy. We describe here the cohort and share the lessons learned. The IRCEP enrolls women tested for SARS-CoV-2 or with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results and obtains information using an online data collection system. By the end of March 2021, 17,532 participants from 77 countries had enrolled; 54% enrolled during pregnancy and 46% afterwards. Among women with symptomatic COVID-19 with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (N=4,934), symptoms were mild in 41%, moderate in 52% and severe in 7%; 7.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 1.7% were admitted to an intensive care unit. The key practical challenge has been retention of the large number of participants enrolled during pregnancy through social media. The biggest methodological challenge has been the potential bias introduced when participants enroll after pregnancy outcomes are known. Multiple biases need to be considered when estimating and interpreting the effects of COVID-19 in pregnancy in these types of cohorts.\n\n\n\n",

Methods for assessing these biases have their own limitations. Many quantitative sensitivity analysis approaches consider each type of bias individually, while more complex approaches are harder to implement or require numerous assumptions. By failing to consider multiple biases at once, researchers can underestimate or overestimate their joint impact. We show that it is possible to bound the total composite bias due to these three sources, and to use that bound to assess the sensitivity of a risk ratio to any combination of these biases. We derive bounds for the total composite bias under a variety of scenarios, providing researchers with tools to assess their total potential impact. We apply this technique to a study where unmeasured confounding and selection bias are both concerns, and to another study in which possible differential exposure misclassification and confounding are concerns. The approach we describe, though conservative, is easier to implement and makes simpler assumptions than quantitative bias analysis. We provide R functions to aid implementation.\n\n\n\n",

Mediation analyses can be valuable in many reproductive health contexts, as mediation analysis can help researchers to better identify, quantify and understand the underlying pathways of the association they are studying.

These selection mechanisms can affect both the internal and external validity of a study. We reviewed approaches to selection mechanisms that affect valid causal inference.\nRecent Findings\nWe noted that selection bias can refer to a number of issues with different consequences. We identified strategies for addressing selection bias when designing studies, collecting data, conducting analyses, and assessing possible bias in those analyses.\nSummary\nUnderstanding the way in which a study sample relates to the target population is critical for avoiding and addressing bias.

This bias can occur whether or not that selected population is the target population and can occur even in the absence of exposure–outcome confounding. However, it is often difficult to quantify the extent of selection bias, and sensitivity analysis can be challenging to undertake and to understand. In this article, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the bias due to selection can be bounded by simple expressions defined by parameters characterizing the relationships between unmeasured factor(s) responsible for the bias and the measured variables. No functional form assumptions are necessary about those unmeasured factors. Using knowledge about the selection mechanism, researchers can account for the possible extent of selection bias by specifying the size of the parameters in the bounds. We also show that the bounds, which differ depending on the target population, result in summary measures that can be used to calculate the minimum magnitude of the parameters required to shift a risk ratio to the null. The summary measure can be used to determine the overall strength of selection that would be necessary to explain away a result. We then show that the bounds and summary measures can be simplified in certain contexts or with certain assumptions. Using examples with varying selection mechanisms, we also demonstrate how researchers can implement these simple sensitivity analyses.\n\n\n\n",

In the industrial zone of Marseille, there is a long history of pollution, but little is known about the health implications. This study documented the prevalence of different health issues in two heavily polluted towns in the industrial zone using a CBPR approach.\nSubject and methods: This study used a CBPR approach and epidemiologic methods to answer community members’ questions about the health of residents in Marseille’s industrial zone by randomly sampling a cross-section of residents to systematically document health issues in Fos-sur-Mer and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône, two towns in the industrial port area of Marseille, France.\nResults: Many chronic illnesses were elevated in these communities, as compared to regional and national prevalences, including chronic skin problems, asthma, cancer, and diabetes. Chronic skin problems and asthma were among the most common chronic illnesses reported. A majority of respondents also reported acute symptoms that affected daily life, including eye irritation or nose and throat problems.\nConclusion: There is likely an environmental explanation for why, even after direct standardization, the prevalences of many diseases were higher in these communities than elsewhere. The combination of CBPR and rigorous epidemiologic methods helps make our findings relevant to both community members and researchers.\n\n\n\n",

Mothers (n=2,952) reported pregnancy and child (n=5,660) developmental information at multiple time points. Child total, internalizing, and externalizing problems at ages 9–11 years were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), collected biennially until 2012. Associations between prepregnancy BMI and child BPI outcomes were examined, as well as two- and three-way interactions by race and gender. Analyses were conducted in 2017.\nResults\nBoys whose mothers had higher prepregnancy weights exhibited higher total BPI and externalizing scores at ages 9–11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers. Boys with severely obese mothers had higher total BPI (mean difference=7.99, 95% CI=3.53, 12.46) and externalizing (mean difference=5.77, 95% CI=1.50, 10.04) scores. Prepregnancy underweight was associated with boys’ higher total BPI (mean difference=2.34, 95% CI=0.02, 4.66) and externalizing (mean difference=3.30, 95% CI=0.69, 5.91); these associations were not significant in sensitivity analyses. No associations emerged for girls or internalizing problems. Two-way interactions by race and three-way interactions by race and gender were not significant.\nConclusions\nMaternal prepregnancy weight was associated with BPI level among boys. Boys with severely obese mothers exhibited markedly higher behavioral problems at ages 9–11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers, regardless of race. Maintaining healthy prepregnancy weight may be important for preventing boys’ deleterious behavior outcomes in middle childhood.\n\n\n\n",
