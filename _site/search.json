Tecumseh\n\n\n\nI’m currently a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University’s Roux Institute in my hometown\nof Portland, ME, working with the Observational Health Data\nSciences and Informatics Center and with colleagues at the Bouvé College of Health\nSciences. Previously I trained in the Program in Population Health\nSciences and the Department of\nEpidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I\nalso have a Master of Science degree from the Department of\nBiostatistics. My research interests are in epidemiologic and\nbiostatistical methods as well as reproductive and child health. I first\ndeveloped these interests at U.C.\nBerkeley, where I earned my M.S. in epidemiology, and while teaching\nthird grade at Little Wound School\nin Kyle, SD, where I lived for three years. Prior to that I studied comparative\nliterature (focusing on literary translation from French and\nPortuguese) and community\nhealth at Brown University.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Red velvet cake\n\n\n\nMy passion for teaching has continued beyond my experience in\nelementary education. I enjoy introducing students to epidemiology and\nbiostatistics as well as delving into more advanced topics in causal\ninference. I love to create teaching materials, some of which can be\nfound on this site.\nI also love hiking and camping, baking, reading novels, and\nprogramming in R. I’m working my way through the New Hampshire 4000 footers and\nthrough Zoë Bakes\nCakes.\n\n\n\nvar myCaptions = document.getElementsByClassName(\"caption\");\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < myCaptions.length; i++) {\n  myCaptions[i].innerHTML = myCaptions[i].innerHTML.slice(11);\n}\n\n\n\n\n",
