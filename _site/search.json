      "contents": "\nI’m an epidemiologist trained in the Program in Population Health Sciences and the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I also have a Master of Science degree from the Department of Biostatistics. My research interests are in epidemiologic and biostatistical methods as well as reproductive and child health. I first developed these interests at U.C. Berkeley, where I earned my M.S. in epidemiology, and while teaching third grade at Little Wound School in Kyle, SD, where I lived for three years. Prior to that I studied comparative literature (focusing on literary translation from French and Portuguese) and community health at Brown University.\nMy passion for teaching has continued beyond my experience in elementary education. I enjoy introducing students to epidemiology and biostatistics as well as delving into more advanced topics in causal inference. I love to create teaching materials, some of which can be found below.\nI also love hiking and camping, reading novels, and programming in R.\n\n\n\n",
