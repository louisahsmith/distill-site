    "text": "Summit of Mt. Tecumseh\n\n\n\nI am an assistant professor in the Department of Health Sciences at Northeastern University’s Bouvé College of Health Sciences and at the Roux Institute in my hometown of Portland, ME. Previously I trained in the Program in Population Health Sciences and the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I also have a Master of Science degree from the Department of Biostatistics. My research interests are in epidemiologic and biostatistical methods as well as reproductive and child health. I first developed these interests at U.C. Berkeley, where I earned my M.S. in epidemiology, and while teaching third grade at Little Wound School in Kyle, SD, where I lived for three years. Prior to that I studied comparative literature (focusing on literary translation from French and Portuguese) and community health at Brown University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed velvet cake\n\n\n\nMy passion for teaching has continued beyond my experience in elementary education. I enjoy introducing students to epidemiology and biostatistics as well as delving into more advanced topics in causal inference. I love to create teaching materials, some of which can be found on this site.\nI also love hiking and camping, baking, reading novels, and programming in R. I’m working my way through the New Hampshire 4000 footers and through Zoë Bakes Cakes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Much of the evidence about what improves and impairs human health is derived from observational data. However, naïve analyses can result in biased and misleading conclusions. One tool that can help us better use observational data for causal inference is the target trial, which invokes the principles of randomized controlled trials to design and analyze observational studies.\nIn this talk I will present the design and analysis of two observational studies using these principles. First, I will describe some pitfalls in estimating the risk of preterm birth after COVID-19 and introduce a strategy to produce meaningful comparisons between pregnancies that were and weren’t affected by COVID-19. Using this method in a registry of pregnant women during the pandemic, we find a large increase in risk of preterm birth after severe COVID-19 late in pregnancy, but not after milder disease or earlier in pregnancy.\nNext, I will discuss an open question about prostate cancer treatment that is unlikely to ever be addressed in a trial, and I will describe how to answer it in observational data using inverse probability weighting or the parametric g-formula. A comparison of the results from each analysis points to the importance of fully specifying a sustained treatment strategy, as well as to inadequacies in our data for answering questions about this particular strategy."
